# DeepLens Astro Pi project

Water is fundamental for life sustainability and development on Earth and others planets.
Aware of how important this resource is, the Bergson Highschool team will build an experiment to evaluate Earth surface covered by water: 72%. To do so, we are going to leverage the new Astro Pi ML capabilities by building an object detector customised for water area detection: ocean, seas, lake, glacier and river. By taking high frequence picture of Earth from ISS (more than 1000) with the Coral TPU accelerator, we are going to build an estimator of water surface average as well as the dispersion around this value.
